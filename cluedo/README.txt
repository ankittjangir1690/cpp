Description:

This is a simple personal assistant for playing the board game Clue (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo) that makes the note taking process less painful.

The user of the program begins playing the game by initializing the user names and the left over card names. Then as the game progresses, the user provides the following information for the player asking the question,

- User name
- Card name trio 
- Yes or no response (in regard to the card trio)

If a unique card combination is found that doesn't exists with any of the players, the program prints those names. At that point, the game ends.

Dependencies:
- C++11
- Boost library
